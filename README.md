### 📄 **README.md** – *Ticket Management Dashboard*

---

 📌 **Project Overview**

This project presents a **Ticket Management Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, based on a dataset containing support or service tickets. The dashboard is intended for IT helpdesk, customer support, or service operations teams to track and analyze ticket volumes, resolution times, categories, and agent performance.



 📁 **Project Files**

* `Ticket_Management_Dataset.xlsx`: Source Excel dataset (raw ticket entries)
* `Ticket DB.pbix`: Power BI file with pre-built visual dashboards



 📊 **Dataset Columns**

Here are the commonly included columns in the dataset:

| Column Name           | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ticket ID             | Unique identifier for each support ticket                          |
| Date Created          | Date and time when the ticket was submitted                        |
| Date Resolved         | Date and time when the ticket was closed/resolved                  |
| Status                | Current state of the ticket (Open, In Progress, Closed, Escalated) |
| Priority              | Ticket urgency level (Low, Medium, High, Critical)                 |
| Category              | Category of the issue (e.g., Hardware, Software, Network, Access)  |
| Subcategory           | More specific classification of the issue                          |
| Department            | Department that raised the ticket                                  |
| Assigned Agent        | Support staff assigned to resolve the ticket                       |
| Resolution Time (hrs) | Time taken to resolve the ticket                                   |
| Feedback Score        | Customer feedback score (1–5) after resolution                     |



 💡 **Usage Ideas**

* Monitor real-time ticket volumes by priority, status, and department
* Identify SLA breaches and bottlenecks in resolution
* Track agent performance based on average resolution time and feedback score
* Highlight frequently recurring categories or departments
* Measure workload distribution across the support team



 🛠️ **Tools Used**

 **Power BI Desktop (.pbix)**: Interactive dashboards with slicers, filters, and DAX-based measures
 **Excel**: Data source preprocessing, filters, pivot tables



### 📈 Key Insights You Can Derive

1. **Ticket Volume & Status**

   * Track open vs. resolved tickets over time
   * Identify trends in ticket spikes (e.g., specific days, departments, or categories)

2. **Priority Management**

   * Analyze whether high-priority tickets are resolved faster than low ones
   * Detect backlogs of critical tickets that need escalation

3. **Agent Performance**

   * Compare average resolution times by agent
   * Highlight top-performing agents based on resolution time and feedback

4. **Departmental Trends**

   * Departments with the most tickets may indicate process or tech issues
   * Identify recurring issues in specific teams

5. **Customer Feedback**

   * Track trends in customer satisfaction (Feedback Score)
   * Correlate low scores with specific agents, categories, or delays

6. **SLA Monitoring**

   * Visualize tickets that breached Service Level Agreements (e.g., >24 hours for high priority)
   * Enable alerts or conditional formatting for SLA violations
